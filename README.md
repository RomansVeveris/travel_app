This is a mobile app developed with Flutter. The project mainly focuses on:

## Features

- Contains reusable code fragments located in the `widgets/` folder to improve readability and maintainability.  
- Includes pages like `plan_a_trip.dart` that implement custom UI solutions matching the original Figma design closely.
